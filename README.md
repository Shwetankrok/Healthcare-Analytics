<br><b>To predict Days Stay in Hospital for patients using the patient health details and Hopsital Details</b></br>

<br>Data can be downloaded from : https://www.kaggle.com/vin1234/janatahack-healthcare-analytics-ii </br>
<br>It is a classification problem where Stay is target variable and it is updated to predict whether the patient will be in hospital for:</br>
<br>0 - 20 days </br>
<br>21-30 days </br>
<br>31-60 daysÂ¶ </br>
<br>60+ days </br>

<br><Task> Performed data cleaning like handling categorical features, null values, grouping category for a feature, downsampling to get all target labels have same number of records and not imbalanced.</br>
<br>Implemented Random Forest considering all features, top 15 features and also Hyperparameter Tuning to get best results</br>
<br>Implemented Logistic Regression removed all multicollinearity with Variable Inflation factor(VIF) and did Hyperparameter Tuning on top features</br>
<br><br>Implemented Decision Tree considering all features, top 15 features and also Hyperparameter Tuning to get best results</br>
